# ASTHMA 
JEFFREY M. DRAZEN AND ELISABETH H. BEL 
## DEFINITION 
Asthma is a clinical syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent episodes of airway obstruction that resolve spontaneously or as a result of treatment. These changes occur in the setting of various types of airway inflammation that are thought to reflect specific endotypes of this clinical syndrome. Although airway obstruction is largely reversible, some changes in the asthmatic airway may be irreversible. 
## EPIDEMIOLOGY
Asthma is an extremely common disorder affecting boys more commonly than girls and, after puberty, women slightly more commonly than men; approximately 8% of the adult population of the United States has signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of asthma. Although most cases begin before the age of 25 years, new-onset asthma may develop at any time throughout life. An estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, with 250,000 annual deaths attributed to the disease.[^1]
The worldwide prevalence of asthma increased more than 50% in the latter half of the 20th century. In the first decade of the 21st century, the prevalence of wheezing in children increased by about 0.1% per year, although it seems to have reached a plateau by 2015.
During the period from 1980 to 2010, the greatest increases in the prevalence of asthma have occurred in countries that adopted an “industrialized” lifestyle without contact with farm animals. In contrast, being raised in a farming environment in close contact with cows is associated with a much lower risk of asthma, independent of genetic factors. 
## PATHOBIOLOGY
### Genetics
In twin studies, asthma has about 60% heritability, indicating that both genetic and environmental factors are important in its etiology. Multiple genome-wide association studies have shown that there are multiple genetic loci associated with asthma. Each contributes only a small fraction of the total disease burden, and even when considered together, they can explain only a small fraction of the prevalence of asthma. 
### Pathology
The asthma syndrome is characterized by marked heterogeneity in clinical expression, environmental triggers, and immunopathologic mechanisms. Traditionally, clinicians have identified only two forms of asthma, atopic and non-atopic asthma, but it has become clear that this division into two subtypes is an oversimplification, and that multiple mechanisms also referred to as “endotypes” can lead to the “classic” signs and symptoms of asthma. 
Atopic or allergic asthma represents the most common and most studied subtype of asthma. It is characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated sensitization to environmental allergens and can be observed in almost all school-aged children with asthma and about half of adult asthmatics. Inflammation and remodeling of the airways are characteristic pathologic features of atopic asthma. Remodeling changes include epithelial fragility, edema and hyperemia of the mucosa, and thickening of the subepithelial reticular basement due to deposition of collagen type III and IV. In more severe chronic asthma, the airway wall thickens as a result of hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, hypertrophy of mucus secreting glands, and subepithelial angiogenesis. Infiltration of the airway wall with inflammatory cells including adaptive T helper-2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, and eosinophils is a general finding, and occurs even in the mildest cases of atopic asthma. 
Th2 cells initiate and propagate the inflammatory cascade associated with allergy by producing a variety of cytokines. These cytokines include interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 induces B-cell proliferation and is capable of stimulating these cells to produce IgE. IL-13 has similar effects of those to IL-4 with respect to B-cell stimulation and IgE production but, in addition, induces airway hyperresponsiveness, goblet cell metaplasia, and mucus hypersecretion. IL-5 plays a major role in the regulation of eosinophil formation, maturation, recruitment, and survival. Increased production of IL-5 may be related to the pathogenesis of severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Mast cells are found in close association with airway smooth muscle cells and are classically activated by allergens when IgE is bound to the high affinity IgE receptor. IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and activation results in the release of histamine and in the generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandins, which contribute to bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness. 
Eosinophils accumulate in the airways after allergen exposure in sensitized persons. Upon activation these cells release toxic granule products (e.g., major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein) that can damage airway epithelium and nerves. These cells also produce lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and platelet activating factor, and a range of cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines. 
Non-atopic or intrinsic asthma develops in adulthood and accounts for less than 5% of cases of asthma. It is not associated with allergies, is often accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis, and is poorly responsive to inhaled glucocorticoids. The eosinophilic airway inflammation observed in this type of asthma is not dependent on adaptive immunity but is likely caused by type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that produce high amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. The growth and maturation of ILC2 cells are stimulated by epithelial cytokines (“alarmins”), which are induced by chronic exposure to pollutants, viruses, or fungi. ILC2 cells produce little IL-4, so there is no associated IgE response from B-cells. Patients with intrinsic asthma often have a severe form of asthma with elevated eosinophil counts in peripheral blood, and generally require high doses of systemic glucocorticoids to keep their asthma under control. 
Both atopic and intrinsic asthma are so called “Type-2-high” asthma phenotypes. However, cluster analyses of large cohorts of adult patients with asthma have identified at least three subtypes of asthma that are not characterized by the presence of Type 2 cytokines or eosinophilic airway inflammation. These “Type-2-low” subtypes of asthma are characterized by increased numbers of neutrophils in the airway or no airway inflammation at all. One increasingly recognized “Type-2-low” asthma phenotype is obesity-associated asthma. This type of asthma occurs later in life, usually in female patients without prior airway disease. The mechanism of obesity associated asthma is not well understood. Other “Type-2-low” phenotypes of asthma include certain forms of occupational asthma (Chapter 87) (e.g., isocyanate-induced asthma), neutrophilic asthma with subclinical microbial infection, and asthma in athletes (e.g., in endurance aquatic sports). In clinical practice in adults, different asthma phenotypes often coexist and interact within the same patient, thereby underscoring the need for a personalized and targeted management approach.
### Physiological Changes in Asthma 
Increased resistance to airflow is the hallmark of asthma; it is due to airway obstruction resulting from smooth muscle constriction, thickening of the airway epithelium, and free liquid within the airway lumen. Obstruction to airflow is manifested by increased airway resistance and decreased flow rates throughout the vital capacity. At the onset of an asthma attack, obstruction occurs at all airway levels; as the attack resolves, these changes are reversed— first in the large airways (i.e., mainstem, lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi) and then in the more peripheral airways. This anatomic sequence of onset and reversal is reflected in the physiological changes observed during resolution of an asthmatic episode. Specifically, as an asthma attack resolves, flow rates first normalize at volumes high in the vital capacity and only later at volumes low in the vital capacity. Because asthma is largely an airway disease rather than an air space disease, no primary changes occur in the static pressure volume curve of the lungs. However, during an acute attack of asthma, airway narrowing may be so severe as to result in airway closure, with individual lung units closing at a volume that is near their maximal volume. This closure results in a change of the pressure-volume curve such that for a given contained gas volume within the thorax, elastic recoil is decreased, which in turn further depresses expiratory flow rates. 
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, which is the transient narrowing of the airways after exercise, occurs frequently among athletes who may not have asthma or even have any respiratory symptoms. The mechanism is uncertain, but the key stimulus is probably airway dehydration because of increased ventilation.
Additional factors influence the mechanical behavior of the lungs during an acute attack of asthma. During inspiration in an asthma attack, the maximal inspiratory pleural pressure becomes more negative than the subatmospheric pressure of 4 to 6 cm H2O usually required for tidal airflow. The expiratory phase of respiration also becomes active as the patient tries to force air from the lungs. As a consequence, peak pleural pressures during expiration, which normally are, at most, only a few centimeters of water above atmospheric pressure, may be as high as 20 to 30 cm H2O above atmospheric pressure. The low pleural pressures during inspiration tend to dilate airways, whereas the high pleural pressures during expiration tend to narrow airways. During an asthma attack, the wide pressure swings, coupled with alterations in the mechanical properties of the airway wall, lead to a much higher resistance to expiratory airflow than to inspiratory airflow. 
The respiratory rate is usually rapid during an acute asthmatic attack. This tachypnea is driven not by abnormalities in arterial blood gas composition but rather by stimulation of intrapulmonary receptors with subsequent effects on central respiratory centers. One consequence of the combination of airway narrowing and rapid airflow rates is a heightened mechanical load on the ventilatory pump. During a severe attack, the load can increase the work of breathing by a factor of 10 or more and can predispose to fatigue of the ventilatory muscles. With respect to gas exchange, the patchy nature of asthmatic airway narrowing results in a maldistribution of ventilation (V) relative to pulmonary perfusion (Q). A shift occurs from the normal preponderance of V/Q units, with a ratio of near unity, to a distribution with a large number of alveolar-capillary units, with a V/Q ratio of less than unity. The net effect is to induce arterial hypoxemia. In addition, the hyperpnea of asthma is reflected as hyperventilation with a low arterial Pco2.

## CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
### History
During an acute asthma attack, patients seek medical attention for shortness of breath accompanied by cough, wheezing, and anxiety. The degree of breathlessness experienced by the patient is not closely related to the degree of airflow obstruction but is often influenced by the acuteness of the attack. Dyspnea may occur only with exercise (exercise-induced asthma), after treatment with agents inhibiting the actions of cyclooxygenase 1 (aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease),2 after exposure to a specific known allergen (extrinsic asthma), or for no identifiable reason (intrinsic asthma). Variants of asthma exist in which cough, hoarseness, or inability to sleep through the night is the only symptom. Identification of a provoking stimulus through careful questioning helps establish the diagnosis of asthma and may be therapeutically useful if the stimulus can be avoided. Most patients with asthma complain of shortness of breath when they are exposed to rapid changes in the temperature and humidity of inspired air. For example, during the winter months in less temperate climates, patients commonly become short of breath on leaving a heated house; in warm humid climates, patients may complain of shortness of breath on entering a cold dry room, such as an air-conditioned theater. 
An important factor to consider in taking a history from a patient with asthma is the potential for occupational exposures in asthma (Chapter 87). Asthma that is brought on by occupational exposures is termed occupational asthma; preexisting asthma that is exacerbated by workplace exposures is termed workplace-exacerbated asthma. In reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, a single large exposure leads to a persistent asthma-like phenotype in a previously normal individual. 
### Physical Examination
Vital Signs Common features noted during an acute attack of asthma include a rapid respiratory rate (often 25 to 40 breaths per minute), tachycardia, and pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated inspiratory decrease in the systolic pressure). The magnitude of the pulsus is related to the severity of the attack; a value greater than 15 mm Hg indicates an attack of moderate severity. Pulse oximetry, with the patient respiring ambient air, commonly reveals an oxygen saturation near 90%. Thoracic Examination Inspection may reveal that patients experiencing acute attacks of asthma are using their accessory muscles of ventilation; if so, the skin over the thorax may be retracted into the intercostal spaces during inspiration. The chest is usually hyperinflated, and the expiratory phase is prolonged relative to the inspiratory phase. Percussion of the thorax demonstrates hyperresonance, with loss of the normal variation in dullness due to diaphragmatic movement; tactile fremitus is diminished. Auscultation reveals wheezing, which is the cardinal physical finding in asthma but does not establish the diagnosis (Chapter 77). Wheezing, commonly louder during expiration but heard during inspiration as well, is characterized as polyphonic in that more than one pitch may be heard simultaneously (Video 81-1). Accompanying adventitious sounds may include rhonchi, which are suggestive of free secretions in the airway lumen, or rales, which should raise the suspicion of an alternative diagnosis and are indicative of localized infection or heart failure. The loss of intensity or the absence of breath sounds in a patient with asthma is an indication of severe airflow obstruction.

## DIAGNOSIS 
### Laboratory Findings 
#### Pulmonary Function Findings 
A decrease in airflow rates throughout the vital capacity is the cardinal pulmonary function abnormality during an asthmatic episode.3 The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the maximal mid-expiratory flow rate (MMEFR) are all decreased in asthma (Chapter 79). In severe asthma, dyspnea may be so severe as to prevent the patient from performing a complete spirogram. In this case, if 2 seconds of forced expiration can be recorded, useful values for PEFR and FEV1 can be obtained. Gradation of attack severity (Table 81-1) must be assessed by objective measures of airflow; no other methods yield accurate and reproducible results.

</table></div>
As the attack resolves, the PEFR and the FEV1 increase toward normal together while the MMEFR remains substantially depressed; as the attack resolves further, the FEV1 and the PEFR may normalize while the MMEFR remains depressed ([[Fig. 81-1.png]]). 
![[Fig. 81-1.png]]
Even when the attack has fully resolved clinically, residual depression of the MMEFR is not uncommon; this depression may resolve during a prolonged course of treatment. If the patient is able to cooperate such that more complete measurements of lung function can be made, lung volume measurements made during an attack demonstrate an increase in both total lung capacity and residual volume; the changes in total lung capacity and residual volume resolve with treatment. Because of the extra cooperation needed for this testing, it is not advised during an acute asthmatic event but is indicated before discharge in a patient hospitalized for the treatment of asthma or between episodes of asthma. 
Pulmonary function testing obtained when the patient is relatively stable usually demonstrates airway obstruction, as indicated by low FEV1 (as a percentage of the patient’s predicted value), low forced vital capacity, and slightly elevated total lung capacity and residual volume values. These results may fully normalize after administration of a bronchodilator, but a “bronchodilator response” is canonically defined as a 12% increase in the FEV1, provided it is at least 200 mL (E-Fig. 81-1).

#### Exhaled NO
The fraction of NO• in the exhaled air (FeNO) is elevated in patients with asthma. Although the exact concentration considered “elevated” will vary with the details of the technique used to obtain the gas sample, a concentration of 20 to 25 parts per billion is a convenient and reliable level that can be used to distinguish people without asthma from patients with untreated asthma. 

#### Arterial Blood Gases
Blood gas analysis need not be undertaken in individuals with mild asthma. If the asthma is of sufficient severity to merit prolonged observation, however, blood gas analysis is indicated; in such cases, hypoxemia and hypocapnia are the rule. With the subject breathing ambient air near sea level, the Pao2 is usually between 55 and 70 mm Hg and the Paco2 between 25 and 35 mm Hg. At the onset of the attack, an appropriate pure respiratory alkalemia is usually evident; with attacks of prolonged duration, the pH returns toward normal as a result of a compensatory metabolic acidemia. A normal Paco2 in a patient with moderate to severe airflow obstruction is reason for concern because it may indicate that the mechanical load on the respiratory system is greater than can be sustained by the ventilatory muscles and that respiratory failure is imminent. When the Paco2 increases in such settings, the pH decreases quickly because the bicarbonate stores have become depleted as a result of renal compensation for the prolonged preceding respiratory alkalemia. Because this chain of events can take place rapidly, close observation is indicated for asthmatic patients with “normal” Paco2 levels and moderate to severe airflow obstruction.

#### Other Blood Findings
Asthmatic patients are frequently atopic; thus, blood eosinophilia is common but not universal. The number of eosinophils in a microliter of blood has been used as a method to forecast a given patient’s response to anti-cytokine treatment in asthma (see below). In addition, elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) are often documented. If indicated by the patient’s history, specific immunosorbent tests, which measure IgE directed against specific offending antigens, can be conducted. Epidemiologic studies indicate that asthma is unusual in subjects with low IgE levels, but some patients with severe asthma have high blood eosinophil levels with low IgE levels.

#### Radiographic Findings
The chest radiograph of a subject with asthma is often normal. Severe asthma is associated with hyperinflation, as indicated by depression of the diaphragm and abnormally lucent lung fields. Complications of severe asthma, including subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum (E-Fig. 81-2), and pneumothorax, may be detected radiographically. In mild to moderate asthma without adventitious sounds other than wheezing, a chest radiograph need not be obtained; if the asthma is of sufficient severity to merit hospital admission, a chest radiograph is advised. 

#### Electrocardiographic Findings
The electrocardiogram, except for sinus tachycardia, is usually normal in acute asthma. However, right axis deviation, right bundle branch block, “P pulmonale,” or even ST-T wave abnormalities may arise during severe asthma and resolve as the attack resolves. 

#### Sputum Findings
The sputum of the asthmatic patient may be either clear or opaque with a green or yellow tinge. The presence of color does not invariably indicate infection, and examination of a Gram-stained and Wright-stained sputum smear is indicated. The sputum often contains eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals (crystallized eosinophil lysophospholipase), Curschmann spirals (bronchiolar casts composed of mucus and cells), or Creola bodies (clusters of airway epithelial cells with identifiable cilia that, in fresh samples, can often be seen to beat), which can affect color without the presence of infection. Asthma specialists may examine induced sputum samples to help identify specific asthma endotypes.

### Differential Diagnosis
Asthma is easy to recognize in a young patient without comorbid medical conditions who has exacerbating and remitting airway obstruction accompanied by blood eosinophilia. A rapid response to bronchodilator treatment is usually all that is needed to establish the diagnosis. However, in the patient with cryptic episodic shortness of breath, an elevated FeNO can help establish a diagnosis of asthma. However, in the absence of an elevated FeNO, other causes of wheezing (see Table 77-4) should be investigated. In fact, up to one third of patients who have physician-diagnosed asthma may not actually have asthma when they are studied systematically.4,5

## PROGNOSIS
Asthma is a chronic relapsing disorder. Most patients have recurrent attacks without a major loss in lung function for many years. A minority of patients experience a significant irreversible loss in lung function over and above the normal pulmonary senescence. Methods to distinguish these various clinical phenotypes have not been developed.

## Prevention and Treatment
The treatment of asthma is directed at two distinct facets of the disease: the control of symptoms and the prevention of exacerbations. 
Symptomatic control is measured by the severity and frequency of asthma symptoms during the day, including limitations of activities of daily life, the need to use “rescue” β-agonist inhalers, and asthma symptoms that wake the patient from sleep. The prevention of exacerbations is less linked to symptoms than to levels of lung function, so management must include objective measures of lung function. The best measure is FEV1, but measures of PEFR can be substituted. Inexpensive and easy-to-use peak flowmeters make the measurement feasible in virtually all cases.
Treatment of asthma has two components. The first is the use of acute reliever (rescue) agents (i.e., bronchodilators) for acute asthmatic airway obstruction. The second is the use of controller treatments, which modify the asthmatic airway environment so that acute airway narrowing, requiring rescue treatments, occurs much less frequently. 
In a given individual, the intensity of asthma treatment is adjusted, for the most part, to achieve five goals: 
1. to allow the patient to pursue the activities of her or his daily life without excessive interference from asthma; 
2. to allow the patient to sleep without awakening because of asthmatic symptoms; 
3. to minimize the use of rescue bronchodilator treatment; 
4. to prevent the need for unscheduled medical care; and 
5. to maintain lung function reasonably near normal. 
A patient who meets these standards on the basis of a careful history, chest examination, and measurement of lung function is said to be “in control,” whereas a patient whose disease activities prevent these goals from being met is said to be “out of control.” Patients who are not in control should have their treatment stepped up, whereas patients whose asthma is in good control for 3 months should attempt to have their treatment stepped down (Fig. 81-2).

### Rescue Treatments 
All patients with asthma should be prescribed a rapid-acting β-agonist rescue inhaler (Table 81-2) to use if acute asthmatic airway obstruction develops. Patients should be shown how to use the inhaler (Video 81-2) and tested for their ability to use it correctly. All albuterol inhalers now contain hydrofluoroalkane propellants to protect the ozone layer, but these gasses may have a greenhouse effect. Aerosol “spacers” can help patients who have difficulty in coordinating their inspiratory effort and inhaler actuation. For an acute exacerbation, a selfdirected quadrupling of an inhaled glucocorticoid can abort the exacerbation and reduce the number of severe exacerbations by about 20%.[^2]
#### A1 β-Adrenergic
Agents Short-acting β-adrenergic agents given by inhalation are the mainstay of bronchodilator treatment of asthma.6 Constricted airway smooth muscle relaxes in response to stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors. β-Adrenergic agonists with varying degrees of β2-selectivity are available for use in inhaled (by nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler; Fig. 81-3), oral, or parenteral preparations. Most patients with mild intermittent asthma should be treated with a short-acting β2-selective inhaler (such as albuterol) on an as-needed basis. Regardless of the specific type of medication used, rescue treatment should consist of two “puffs” from the inhaler, with the first and second puffs separated by a 3- to 5-minute interval, which is thought to allow enough time for the first puff to dilate narrowed airways, thus giving the agent better access to affected areas of the lung. Patients should be instructed to exhale to a comfortable volume, to breathe in very slowly (such as they would when sipping hot soup), and to actuate the inhaler as they inspire. Inspiration to near total lung capacity is followed by holding the breath for 5 seconds to allow the deposition of smaller aerosol particles in more peripheral airways; in a single treatment this process should be repeated. Two such “puffs” can be repeated every 4 to 6 hours; patients should be instructed to “advance” their asthma treatment (Table 81-2) if they need to use more than 12 puffs of a β-agonist in a 72-hour period. 
#### Anticholinergics 
Atropinic agents inhibit the effects of acetylcholine released from the intrapulmonary motor nerves that run in the vagus nerve and innervate airway smooth muscle. Ipratropium bromide, the atropinic agent used therapeutically in asthma, is available in a metered-dose inhaler; the recommended dose is two puffs from a metered-dose inhaler every 4 to 6 hours. In adults inhaled tiotropium (2.5 µg by MDI every morning) can be added to an inhaled glucocorticoid as asthma treatment.[^3]

### Controller Treatments
#### Inhaled Glucocorticoids
Inhaled glucocorticoids, which have less systemic impact than systemic steroids for a given level of therapeutic effect, are effective controller treatments for improving lung function and preventing asthmatic exacerbations in patients with persistent asthma.7 Patients whose disease can be categorized as “mild persistent asthma” can be treated with an inhaled corticosteroid only when they have increased asthma symptoms rather than requiring an inhaled corticosteroid on a regularly scheduled basis.[^4] However, inhaled glucocorticoids do not change the natural history of asthma. All available inhaled glucocorticoids are effective treatments of persistent asthma but differ in terms of cost, the magnitude of adrenal suppression, and the potential for systemic effects, including growth retardation in children, loss of bone mineralization, cataracts, and glaucoma. Overall, no convincing data are available to suggest that there is reason to prefer one corticosteroid to the others. Adverse effects common to all inhaled glucocorticoids are oral thrush and hoarseness (attributed to myopathy of the laryngeal muscles); the risk and severity can be reduced by aerosol spacers and good oropharyngeal hygiene (i.e., rinsing out the mouth by gargling after dosing). Recent data indicate that a combination of a rapid-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled glucocorticoid can be used as “reliever” treatment for patients with mild intermittent to moderate persistent asthma.[^3][^4][^5]
#### Long-Acting β-Agonists
In contrast to short- to medium-acting β-agonists, a number of longacting β-agonists currently are available worldwide. These agents should not be used in patients with asthma unless given as concomitant treatment with an inhaled glucocorticoid. Therefore it is recommended that patients use an inhaler that contains both an inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting β-agonist together so that the treatments with these two agents cannot be separated. 
A number of combination products contain both inhaled steroids and longacting β-agonists in the same aerosol device. These products prevent patients with asthma from using inhaled long-acting β-agonists without inhaled glucocorticoids. When prescribing a combination inhaler, the physician should determine the inhaled dose of glucocorticoid (fluticasone, budesonide, beclomethasone, mometasone, and others) that the patient requires and then choose a combination product that will deliver a dose of long-acting β-agonist with the inhaled glucocorticoid when it is given as two puffs twice per day. The dose of long-acting β-agonist varies with brand and type of inhaler used.
Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that, when used with inhaled glucocorticoids, long-acting β-agonists do not result in a higher frequency of severe asthmatic events compared with inhaled glucocorticoids alone.[^6] However, these studies have been criticized because asthma patients with recent lifethreatening events were excluded. 
#### Antileukotrienes
Agents with the capacity to inhibit the synthesis of the leukotrienes (zileuton, 600 mg four times a day, or controlled-release [Zyflo CR], 1200 mg twice daily) or the action of leukotrienes at the CysLT1 receptor (montelukast [Singulair], 10 mg once a day; pranlukast [Onon, Ultair], 225 mg twice a day, not available in the United States; and zafirlukast [Accolate], 20 mg twice a day) are effective oral controller medications for some patients with mild or moderate persistent asthma.[^7] In patients treated with zileuton, alanine aminotransferase levels should be monitored for the first 3 to 6 months of treatment; if levels rise to more than three times the upper limit of normal, the drug should be stopped. Theophylline metabolism is slowed by zileuton, so monitoring of levels is indicated if both are prescribed. These treatments can be used on their own for mild persistent asthma or in combination with inhaled steroids for more severe asthma.
#### Theophylline
Theophylline and its more water-soluble congener aminophylline are moderately potent bronchodilators that are useful in both inpatient and outpatient management of asthma. Treatment with theophylline is recommended only for patients who have moderate or severe persistent asthma and who are receiving controller medications, such as inhaled steroids or antileukotrienes, but whose asthma is not adequately controlled despite these treatments. 
Theophylline is not widely used because of its toxicity and the wide variations in the rate of its metabolism, both in a single individual over time and among individuals in a population. Because blood levels need to be monitored for optimal dosing, most physicians have reserved theophylline for third- or fourth-line therapy. For most preparations, the starting dose should be about 300 mg/day; the frequency will depend on the preparation used. 
Acceptable plasma levels for therapeutic effects are between 10 and 20 µg/ mL; higher levels are associated with gastrointestinal, cardiac, and central nervous system toxicity, including anxiety, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. Most asthma care providers use dosing amounts and intervals to achieve steady-state theophylline levels of 10 to 14 µg/mL, thereby avoiding the toxicity associated with decrements in metabolism. 
#### Systemic Glucocorticoids
Systemic glucocorticoids are effective for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent asthma8 as well as for occasional severe exacerbations of asthma in a patient with otherwise mild asthma, but the mechanism of their therapeutic effect has not been established. No consensus has been reached on the specific type, dose, or duration of corticosteroid to be used in the treatment of asthma. In nonhospitalized patients with asthma refractory to standard therapy, a steroid “pulse” with initial doses of prednisone on the order of 40 to 60 mg/day, tapered to zero during 7 to 14 days, is recommended. For patients who cannot stop taking steroids without having recurrent uncontrolled bronchospasm despite the addition of multiple other controller treatments, alternate-day administration of oral steroids is preferable to daily treatment. For patients whose asthma requires in-hospital treatment but is not considered life-threatening, an initial intravenous bolus of 2 mg/kg of hydrocortisone, followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/hour, has been shown to be beneficial within 12 hours. In attacks of asthma that are considered life-threatening, the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg every 6 hours) has been advocated. In each case, as the patient improves, oral steroids are substituted for intravenous steroids, and the oral dose is tapered during 1 to 3 weeks; addition of inhaled steroids to the regimen is strongly recommended when oral steroids are started. 
#### Monoclonal Antibody Treatment 
##### Omalizumab
Subcutaneous administration of omalizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that binds circulating IgE, is associated with decreased serum free (not total) IgE levels. In patients who have moderate to severe allergic asthma with elevated levels of serum IgE and who are receiving inhaled glucocorticoids, omalizumab treatment improves asthma control even as doses of inhaled steroids are decreased.[^8] Dosing is guided by weight and by pretreatment IgE levels: a monthly subcutaneous dose of 0.016 mg × body weight (kg) × IgE level (IU/mL). For example, in a patient weighing 70 kg with a pretreatment total IgE level of 300 IU/mL, 336 mg of omalizumab would be administered monthly by subcutaneous injection. Dosing calculators can be found online (e.g., http://www.xolairhcp.com/hcp/determining-the-dose.html). Anti-IgE antibodies can reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life in patients with severe allergic asthma, but their place in treatment schema has not been fully established. Because of the potential for anaphylaxis, all patients need to be monitored after injection; the duration of the monitoring period is not specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but most physicians monitor for 30 to 60 minutes.
##### Mepolizumab (Nucala) and Reslizumab (Cinqair) 
Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-5. In randomized trials, it reduces asthma exacerbations by about 50% among patients with severe asthma who still have blood eosinophils greater than 150 cells/µL despite treatment with oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. In patients requiring daily oral glucocorticoid therapy to maintain asthma control, mepolizumab has a significant glucocorticoid-sparing effect.[^9] The dose is 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. 
Reslizumab is another humanized monoclonal antibody against circulating IL-5 for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, which showed similar reductions of annual exacerbation rate as mepolizumab. In randomized trials, it reduced the frequency of exacerbations by about 50% in patients who had asthma and elevated blood eosinophil counts and who were inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroid-based therapy.[^10] All these monoclonal antibodies are quite expensive, and most insurance companies require specific clearance before the drug can be administered.

#### Other Monoclonal Antibodies 
Benralizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the α subunit of the IL-5 receptor that induces near-complete depletion of eosinophils and basophils in the circulation and lung tissue. In randomized trials, benralizumab (30 mg subcutaneously every 4 to 8 weeks) reduced exacerbations by 50% and improved lung function in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, often despite a reduced dose of oral glucocorticoids.[^11]
In patients with moderate to severe asthma, dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against the α subunit of the shared interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 receptor (at 300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks), can improve the control of asthma and allow the dose of inhaled glucocorticoid to be reduced, oftentimes with an improvement in lung function as well.[^12] [^13] Tezepelumab, a human monoclonal antibody specific for the epithelial-cell-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (at 70 to 280 mg given intravenously every four weeks), has also been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations among patients treated with long-acting β-antagonists and medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids.[^14] 

#### Other Controller Drugs 
Cromolyn sodium (two to four times a day by nebulizer using 20-mg nebules) is a nonsteroid inhaled treatment used in the management of mild to moderate persistent asthma. It appears to be most useful in pediatric populations or when an identifiable stimulus (such as exercise or allergen exposure) elicits an asthmatic response. 
Exacerbations of asthma may be triggered by infection. Data suggest that azithromycin (500 mg 3 times a week for 48 weeks) can reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life in patients with persistent symptoms but at the expense of more diarrhea and an unknown risk of selecting resistant organisms.[^15]
Based on the concern that asthma could be caused by silent gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment with a proton pump inhibitor has been advocated in patients with mild to moderate asthma even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Adequately powered clinical studies suggest that this approach provides no benefit for asthma control.

### Vaccination for Seasonal Influenza and Pneumococcal Disease 
Vaccination of patients for seasonal influenza is safe and not associated with enhanced asthma exacerbations. Vaccination against seasonal influenza and pneumococcal disease is recommended in patients with asthma. 
### Radio Frequency Ablation of Airway Smooth Muscle 
A proprietary system to ablate airway smooth muscle by delivery of radio frequency energy through a bronchoscopically placed probe has reduced asthma exacerbations in sham-controlled trials among patients whose asthma remained out of control despite the use of multiple controller medications.[^16] Although a device for such treatment has been approved by the FDA, the long-term impacts of this treatment on airway or lung function are not known and specific recommendations with respect to its use are not available.
### Control-Driven Asthma Therapy 
All current asthma treatment is symptomatic (i.e., no current treatment has been proven to change the disease history), so the standard approach in the management of asthma is to titrate treatment to achieve an adequate level of control.
If a patient’s asthma is well controlled, treatment can be continued or stepped down (see Fig. 81-2). If a patient’s asthma is poorly controlled, treatment intensity should be stepped up. At the mild end of the spectrum, a patient who has rare limitations in activities of daily life, has nearly normal lung function, and sleeps without interruption from asthma can be prescribed nothing more than inhaled rescue treatment on an as-needed basis. In general, if a patient can control his or her asthma with the use of a single metered-dose inhaler of rescue treatment dispensed every 7 to 8 weeks or less frequently, there is no need for background controller treatment. If a patient has a requirement for more rescue treatment, has symptoms that interfere with sleeping through the night, or has moderately deranged lung function, controller therapy should be added. Whether inhaled glucocorticoids may provide benefit with respect to preventing future exacerbations in asymptomatic patients remains uncertain.[^17] 
When single-agent controller therapy is started, it should consist of an inhaled glucocorticoid or an antileukotriene. If control is not achieved with one of these agents, the patient can be switched to the other or have a second agent added. The best studied two-agent combination is an inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist, available in a single inhaler under a variety of formulations sold under many trade names. These combinations provide excellent disease control and often allow a reduction in the dose of the inhaled glucocorticoid. Data indicate that another combination, an antileukotriene and inhaled steroid, is more effective than either treatment alone, but this regimen does not have as substantial an evidence base as the combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting β-agonist. 
Levels of exhaled nitric oxide are complementary to symptoms in assessing asthma control. In experienced hands, the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide when combined with symptomatic management has been shown to be of some potential value in the day-to-day management of asthma.[^18]

### Specific Treatment Scenarios
#### Concurrent Pulmonary Infection
In some patients, acute exacerbations of asthma may be due to concurrent infection, which requires targeted therapy (Chapters 82, 84, and 91). 
#### Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (Previously Termed Aspirin-Induced Asthma) 
Approximately 5% of patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma develop asthma when they ingest agents that inhibit cyclooxygenase, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.11 Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 are less likely to cause these reactions, but aspirin-type reactions have been reported in sensitive patients treated with selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors. Although the physiological manifestations of laboratory-based aspirin challenge can be blocked by leukotriene pathway inhibitors, these agents do not prevent clinical aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Thus, patients with this form of asthma must avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
#### Asthma in the Emergency Department 
When a patient with asthma presents for acute emergency care, objective measures of the severity of the attack, including quantification of pulsus paradoxus and measurement of airflow rates (PEFR or FEV1), should be evaluated in addition to the usual vital signs. If the attack has been prolonged and failed to respond to treatment with bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol by metered-dose inhaler, two puffs every 2 to 3 hours) and high-dose inhaled steroids (e.g., more than 2000 µg/day of beclomethasone or half that amount of fluticasone) before arrival at the emergency department, intravenous steroids (40 to 60 mg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent) should be administered. If the patient has not been receiving treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist, such agents should be administered (10 mg of montelukast or 20 mg of zafirlukast) as soon as possible. Treatment with inhaled β-agonists (either nebulized albuterol, 0.5 mL of a 0.5% solution repeated at 20- to 30-minute intervals, or albuterol by metered-dose inhaler, two puffs every 30 minutes) should be used until the PEFR or FEV1 increases to greater than 40% of the predicted values. If this point is not reached within 2 hours, admission to the hospital for further treatment is strongly advocated. 
When patients have PEFR and FEV1 values that are greater than 60% of their predicted value on arrival in the emergency department, treatment with inhaled β2-agonists alone, albuterol (0.5 mL of an albuterol 0.083% solution) or equivalent, is likely to result in an objective improvement in airflow rates. If significant improvement takes place in the emergency department, such patients can usually be treated as outpatients with inhaled β2-agonists and a controller agent (see Fig. 81-2). A good strategy is to add inhaled glucocorticoids if the patient has not been receiving this treatment or has been using a single controller therapy.
For patients whose PEFR and FEV1 values are between 40 and 60% of the values predicted at the time of initial evaluation in the emergency care setting, a plan of treatment varying in intensity between these two plans is indicated. Failure to respond to treatment by objective criteria (PEFR or FEV1) within 2 hours of arrival at the emergency department is an indication for the use of systemic glucocorticoids. 
#### Status Asthmaticus
The asthmatic subject whose PEFR or FEV1 does not increase to greater than 40% of the predicted value with treatment, whose PaCO2 increases without improvement of indices of airflow obstruction, or who develops major complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum should be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring. Frequent treatments with inhaled β-agonists (0.5 mL of an albuterol 0.083% solution every 2 hours), intravenous aminophylline (at doses to yield maximal acceptable plasma levels, that is, 15 to 20 µg/ mL; 500- to 1000-mg loading dose given during an hour followed by an infusion of 30 to 60 mg/hour), and high-dose intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone, 40 to 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours) are indicated. Oxygen should be administered by face mask or nasal cannula in amounts sufficient to achieve SaO2 values between 92% and 94%; a higher FIO2 promotes absorption atelectasis and provides no therapeutic benefit. If objective evidence of an infection is present, appropriate treatment should be given for that infection. If no improvement is seen with treatment and if respiratory failure appears imminent, bronchodilator treatment should be intensified to the maximum tolerated by the patient as indicated by the maximum tolerated heart rate, usually 130 to 140 beats per minute. If indicated, intubation of the trachea and mechanical ventilation can be instituted; in this case, the goal should be to provide a level of ventilation just adequate to sustain life but not sufficient to normalize arterial blood gases. For example, a PaCO2 of 60 to 70 mm Hg, or even higher, is acceptable for a patient in status asthmaticus.

#### Asthma in Pregnancy
Asthma may be exacerbated, remain unchanged, or remit during pregnancy (Chapter 226). There need not be substantial departures from the ordinary management of asthma during pregnancy, although one randomized trial suggests that unlike in other settings, measurement of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide can improve the management of asthma during pregnancy. However, no unnecessary medications should be administered; systemic steroids should be used sparingly to avert fetal complications, and certain drugs should be avoided, including tetracycline (as a treatment of intercurrent infection), ipratropium bromide (which may cause fetal tachycardia), terbutaline (which is contraindicated during active labor because of its tocolytic effects), and iodine-containing mucolytics (such as saturated solution of potassium iodide). Moreover, use of prostaglandin F2α as an abortifacient should be avoided in asthmatic patients
